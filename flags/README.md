# Flags

**Slicing NumPy arrays allows you to edit rectangular blocks of data.**

Here is the code that carves out a red square from the image:

:::include flags.py

Hints:

* the slicing contains an interval `from:to` for each dimension
* the smallest `from` value is zero
* the highest `to` value is the size of that dimension plus one
* negative numbers count from the back
* both `from` and `to` can be omitted
