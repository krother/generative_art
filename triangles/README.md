# Triangles

Arithmetics on a vector with its own transpose results in a matrix.

Cropping selects a triangular section.

### Hints

* the code only works for triangles with two edges parallel to the axes of the coordinate system
* the instruction `a.T` *transposes* the array
* the conditional assignment allows you to set only a part of the values in an array

## Challenge:

Create multiple straight-edge triangles.
