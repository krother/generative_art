# Polygons


![](../images/polygon.png)

Polygons are good for drawing many shapes.
Because the corners (vertices) are vectors, it is easy to scale, rotate or otherwise transform a polygon.
In Numpy, polygons can be drawn with a smart combination of indexing operations.

**CODE IS STILL BUGGY**

:::include polygon.py

### Hints

* the vertices have to be in clockwise order
* check out what the function `np.indices()`
* the **Pillow** library also has a polygon tool

## Challenge:

Draw a repeating pattern.
