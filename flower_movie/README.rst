   flower assembly movie frames

Challenge
---------

Write an animation where an image assembles itself from pieces, like the
`Flower Assembly Movie on YouTube <https://youtu.be/FE6_nx-MKc8>`__.
Split the image into many square-shaped tiles and create a series of
frames as ``.png`` images.

You need
--------

-  an image
-  Python + NumPy + Pillow
-  ``MEncoder`` or a similar program that can assemble several frames to an animation

With MEncoder, you need to run a line similar to the following:

::

   mencoder "mf://*.png" -mf fps=25 -o output.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4

Hints
-----

-  start by creating a very simple animation (e.g. a square moving across the screen)
-  you need about 25 frames per second
-  a trick to create the assembly effect is to **move apart** the squares in random directions, and play that animation backwards
